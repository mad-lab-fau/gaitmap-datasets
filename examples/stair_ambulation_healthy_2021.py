StairAmbulationHealthy2021 - A Stride Segmentation and Event Detection dataset with focus on stairs
===================================================================================================

The dataset can be downloaded from here:

.. note:: The dataset only contains the healthy participants of the full dataset presentent in the paper!

We provide two `tpcp.Dataset` classes to access the data:

1. :class:`mad_datasets.stair_ambulation_healthy_2021.StairAmbulationHealthy2021PerTest`: This class allows to access
   all data and events for each of the performed gait tests individually.
2. :class:`mad_datasets.stair_ambulation_healthy_2021.StairAmbulationHealthy2021Full`: This class allows to access the
   entire recordings for each participants (two recordings per participant) independently of the performed gait tests.

In the following we will show the usage of both classes and the data that is contained within.

# As further groundtruth we provide a label for each segmented stride that contains information about the height
# change during the stride.
# This information is derived by measuring the heights of the individual stair steps and labeling each stride based
# on video, to mark all strides that were performed on a specicic stair configuration.

# Below we plot all the relvant data for a single gait test to make it easier to understand.
#
# For the selected test, we can see that the participant basically started walking right away.
# While it can not be easily seen from the raw data IMU itself, the participant walked down a stair in two bouts.
# This can be more clearly seen in the baro data, which shows a slowly increasing pressure value, indicating a
# reduction in altitude.

# The only difference is that instead of the individual tests, we can see the two parts in the index for the dataset.

# A note on caching
# =================
# To make it possible to interact with the entire dataset, without filling your RAM immediately, all data is only
# loaded once you access the respective data attribute (e.g. `data` or `pressure_data`).
# However, this means, if you access the same piece of data multiple times (or multiple pieces of related data),
# data needs to be loaded again from disk and preprocessed.
# This is slow.
# Therefore, we allow to use `joblib.Memory` to cache the data in a fast disk cache.
# You can configure the cache directory using the `memory` parameter of the dataset class.
# Keep in mind, that the cache directory can become quite large.
# We recommend clearing the cache from time to time, to free up space.
